## Initial Setup Phase

### First Challenges Encountered

When starting the project, we encountered our first major issues during the initial setup phase:

#### 1. Deprecated NPM Packages
- **Challenge**: Dealing with deprecated npm packages that introduced vulnerabilities to the project
- **Issues faced**: 
  - Initial npm packages were outdated and marked as deprecated
  - These deprecated packages introduced security vulnerabilities to the project
  - Had to identify and update vulnerable dependencies
  - Ensuring compatibility when replacing deprecated packages with newer versions
- **Resolution**: Successfully updated all deprecated packages, resolved security vulnerabilities, and established a secure development environment

#### 2. Vercel Framework Detection
- **Challenge**: Configuring Vercel to properly recognize and deploy the Next.js framework
- **Issues faced**:
  - Vercel initially could not detect that we were using the Next.js framework
  - Had to include proper configuration for framework detection
  - Ensuring Vercel uses the correct build settings for Next.js
  - Setting up the appropriate deployment configuration
- **Resolution**: Successfully configured the project to allow Vercel to recognize the Next.js framework and deploy it correctly

### Milestone Achieved
After resolving these initial challenges, we successfully achieved our first milestone: a simple, working Next.js website deployed and accessible via Vercel.
